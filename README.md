## VS Code Notes ##

Shift Command P in VS Code gets the command palette.

Type in "Shell" to make sure that I can write `code .` in terminal to open project.

## Python notes ##

Always have a virtual environment for every project

`dir([thing])` gets a list of all methods on the type of the variable. 
For example
`name="Joel"`
`dir(name)`
Will show the list of all string methods available.


### Variables ###

Cannot start with a number.

Pep8 best practices - name should be all lower case, whole words, separated by an underscore.
`type(x)` will give the variable type.

`None` is the general equivalent of `Null`, class `NoneType`

### Syntax Error ###

Read any syntax errors that show in the command line from bottom to top.
